            Hello, My name is Brendan Brockway, I am 23 years old and in my last semester at MSU. My major is 
            Media and Information and my minor is business.
            <br>
            I am making this blog as part of my lab assignmnet for MI349: Web Design and Development.
            I have a little expirience with coding but none with any markup languages like HTML.
            <br>
                My hobbies include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Golfing</li>
                <li>Watching shows</li>
                <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <br> 
            I hope you gained something from my posts, because even though they are just me talking about myself,
            I think there is something to gain from reading them. Have a nice day!
